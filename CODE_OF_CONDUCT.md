# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want a welcoming, inclusive community. We expect all participants to help create a respectful environment.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent; focus on the problem, not the person
- Use welcoming language; be mindful of different backgrounds and experiences

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Publishing private information (including tokens, credentials, or personal details)
- Threats, doxxing, or sustained disruptive behavior

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it privately:

- security@TODO-REPLACE-ME

(If the report is not security-related, it will still be handled confidentially.)

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions and may temporarily or permanently ban participants for violations.
