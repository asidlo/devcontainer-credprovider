        ⚠️ **For security vulnerabilities, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting instead:**
        
        1. Go to the **Security** tab
        2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
        
        This ensures your report remains private until a fix is available.
        
        Only use this form for general security questions or concerns that are not vulnerabilities.
